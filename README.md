# Entity_Composition
This is an example of adding class funcitons to a 4D entity through composition: instead of extending the EntityDataClass we pass 
the entity into the class as a property.

This can be particularly useful refactoring or updating existing code. It doesn't preclude extedning the dataclass but illustrates how
you can taylor the class to specific operations involving the entity.
